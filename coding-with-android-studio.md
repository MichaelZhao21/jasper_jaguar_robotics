# Coding with Android Studio

## Installation

_\*This can either be really easy or REALLY annoying... Good luck._

1. Start off by going to the [Android Studio Website](https://developer.android.com/studio/) and downloading the installer. Then, follow the instructions to install the program.

2. Next, you want to go to the [FTC Github Repository](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app). Press download ZIP and unzip the file to the place that you want that file to be.

5. Wait while the gradle builds the project. You should see this window:

6. After the processes at the bottom of the window finish, head over to the left side and open one of the samples.

7. If a lot of the text has red underlines, then close the project and try again. You should see something like this once you open that sample:

8. Congratulations! You've just installed the FTC app onto Android Studio. Now go to the teamcode folder and start coding!

## Creating OpModes

There are 2 ways to make new java files:

1. Go to the top of the screen and click File &gt; New &gt; Java File
2. Right Click on the 'teamcode' folder &gt; New &gt; Java File
