# Coding with Android Studio

## Installation

_\*This can either be really easy or REALLY annoying... Good luck._

1. Start off by going to the [Android Studio Website](https://developer.android.com/studio/) and downloading the installer. Then, follow the instructions to install the program.

2. Next, you want to go to the [FTC Github Repository](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app). Press download ZIP and unzip the file to the place that you want that file to be.

3. Open android studio and press import project.

4. Find the gradle project labeled ftc\_app-master; click it and press OK to open the project

5. Wait while the gradle builds the project. You should see this window:

6. After the processes at the bottom of the window finish, head over to the left side and open one of the samples.

7. If a lot of the text has red underlines, then close the project and try again. You should see something like this once you open that sample:

8. Congratulations! You've just installed the FTC app onto Android Studio. Now go to the teamcode folder and start coding!
